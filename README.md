# Snake-Game

This is a Snake Game where players control the snake using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys to move up, left, down, and right. The objective is to eat randomly appearing food items on the screen to make the snake grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the wall or with the snake's own body.
